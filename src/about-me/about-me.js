                    <p>Iâ€™m studying Computer Science with a minor in Business at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
                        I am currently interning at Brunswick Corporation, working on a myriad of different projects, spanning from full-stack development to robotics.
                        In my free time, I love jamming on the guitar or piano with my friends!
