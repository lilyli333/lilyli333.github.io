In the reading, the author mentioned that a group of friends had a rule where when the group met up for meals, there had to be a specific number of them engaged in conversation before she would allow herself to look down at her phone. I wonder if I should ask my friends to implement a similar rule. I agree with that girl how this rule would end up with everyone saying \u201cwhat\u201d to reconnect with the conversation. I see myself and my friends doing the same thing during group conversations. But isn\u2019t being in and out of a conversation better than not being in it at all? I wonder about this all the time. At least in my friend group, there are usually 2 to 3 conversations happening at the same time. All of our attention is divided between the private conversation we are currently having and listening to the other conversations around the table\u2013just in case one became more interesting. This was the norm for my group. And when one conversation is more interesting than the other smaller, private conversations, then everyone stops and comes back together for full-group conversations.

I want to use this weekend to have more meaningful conversations with the people around me and to not get distracted by what might be on my phone. A couple of my friends came over after dinner to play Dutch Blitz and Catan. It was a group that frequently met (pretty much weekly) to play the same two games together. We loved it though. When we are playing, no one was on their phones. We were all totally engrossed in the game! Even when a certain player was taking an extra-long time to decide on their next move, I noticed that no one took the time to pull out their phone. They too, were thinking about their next moves.

While some parts of the drive were filled with silence, there were also meaningful conversations that occurred organically. With no music playing, no one was singing along, and thus the conversations weren\u2019t interrupted by anything. I had a great time looking out the window and just taking in how beautiful the snowy landscape was. Although some people in the car used their phones occasionally to text others, no one was glued to their phones. Once we got to the conference, I didn\u2019t even have time to check my phone! I had a great time playing card games with my friends. We also took a night walk around Indianapolis. When we came across a cool arch-like sculpture, I couldn't help myself but to ask the group to take a group picture in front of it. Since it was close to midnight, there was no one around to take the picture for us. This was where my Apple Watch came in handy.

I also had a blast playing wacky board games during our downtime in the afternoon. I also met a few students from Purdue and we all went to dinner together! It was such a fun time.

It took me multiple tries to get the story just right before posting. This reminded me of how the author in the reading for this class talked about how we prefer telecommunication because it allows us to edit and revise our speech before committing to it (ie posting it). It allows us to control how we come across online. I totally agree with this sentiment. I see myself stumbling over my words sometimes during real-time conversations today.

I can practically quote entire scenes from these shows because of how many times I have rewatched them! But still, I can\u2019t bear to live in silence. Like the author mentioned in the reading for this class, we are scared of solitude and constantly avoid it. I think I was avoiding solitude and being alone with my thoughts by constantly semi-distracting myself and trying to multitask. I was obviously not focused on the show, but nor was I solely focused on the task at hand.

I was tempted to not go out of my personal bubble and to just sit in a conversation that I had no interest in, or to scroll through my phone. Oh, the urge to pull out my phone and randomly scroll through Instagram was so strong! It was so much easier than conversing with co-workers that I barely know. Even though most of us are all interns and all in engineering, it was still hard to find common interests to talk about.

Especially the chapter on the US News college rankings. When I was applying to schools during my senior year of high school, the ranking definitely affected where I applied to. I mostly only applied to private schools and the schools in the top 7 in the rankings for Computer Science. And tada, here I am in the middle of a cornfield simply because UIUC is so highly ranked for computer science! I had never really thought much about how the rankings were made and what were the reasons and criteria behind them. One thing that really stuck out to me from the chapter\u2013that I really pondered on\u2013was how the schools are graded on a curve every year. That means if a college has a lower rank and wants to increase its rank, it can focus on fundraising. They can have the best fundraising year, and get away bigger budget than in previous years. But this might not boost them in the ratings if other schools in the area were able to fundraise a lot more than them in that particular year. This means that even if a college does better when compared to themselves in previous years, they still have to outperform other schools in order to boost their ranking. One of the reasons why I didn\u2019t apply to any University of California schools (I am originally from California) was precisely because they tend to grade students on a curve. This means that only a specific percentage of students got As, Bs, Cs, and so on. This creates an extremely competitive environment, where students don\u2019t care about how much they are learning or how much they are improving from who they were a year ago; but solely care about how they fare against their friends and classmates. To think that the only reason I even applied to UIUC was because of a ranking system that was based on a curve when I didn\u2019t apply to any UCs because of that exact reason shocked me. From now on, I need to do more research before putting my trust in a system and model that I don\u2019t 100% believe in."))}),n.a.createElement(K,{header:"Feb 12 - Saturday",detail:n.a.createElement("div",{className:"flex-row"},n.a.createElement("p",null,"Today, my friends and I celebrated Galentine\u2019s Day.

At the start of the interview season, I wasl extremely nervous whenever I had to take a personality test or do an automated behavioral interview. But as I gained more experience, I realized that the algorithm didn\u2019t care about who I was, but who I was portraying. Thus, even before I had the time to realize it, I began to enter these interviews, not as who I was, but who I wanted to be. If I sense that the company greatly valued diversity, I would play up how I immigrated from China as a child and how my unique perspective as an Asian American women in the tech industry has shaped me into who I am today. If I sense that the company greatly valued grit and perseverance, I would play up projects that tested my endurance. By the end of the interview season, every behavior interview and personality test have become more of a mind game\u2013one where I tried to find what qualities the algorithm valued the most and played into it. It became less about authenticity and more about beating the system. I don\u2019t think I was wrong in doing this. I didn\u2019t lie in any of those tests or interviews. I simply downplayed certain aspects of myself while focusing on aspects of me that the company wanted to see. I don\u2019t like how this was the only way for candidates to pass the interviews and for them to get a good internship and job offer.

Ross believes that the markets should decide societal problems, not the government, that \u201cpeople [should] determine who should win; not the politicians\u201d [2]. These ideals led Ross to create the Silk Road, the \u201cInternet's largest and most sophisticated underground illicit goods market\u201d [3] on the Dark Web. He through that through the Silk Road, he was \u201cchanging the world and making it a better place\u201d [2], a place where drugs are accepted legalized."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"The underlying technology behind the Silk Road was Bitcoin\u201d an anonymous, digital, alternative currency that was outside of the control of any government.

For many, the \u201cSilk Road has become a touchstone for Bitcoin\u2019s utility and its role as a foil to the mainstream economic system\u201d [4]. It was the first real use case for alternative currencies. When the Silk Road was finally taken down, there were 11.7 million bitcoins in circulation. Out of that amount, \u201cthe Silk Road handled BTC 9.5 million in transactions over its two-year life\u201d [5]! Saying that the Silk Road was profitable was an understatement.

I argue that as the Silk Road grew, Ross\u2019s stronghold on Libertarian ideals slipped more and more. At the end of the Silk Road journey, Ross was more enamored with leaving a glorious legacy and a fat wallet than he was of revolutionizing the drug trade. If he had stayed true to the cause, he would not have meticulously planned the perfect escape: one where his money and physical safety are ensured. Instead, he should have revealed his identity to become the true face of the movement. He should not have hid behind his computer and keyboard in the dark, but instead, have rallied his fellows in broad daylight. Another issue I find with Ross\u2019s character was how he never shared his earning calls nor Silk Road source code with the world.
